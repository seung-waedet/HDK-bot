Have you ever encountered a religion that tries to liberate God? People usually use religion to ask for blessings. |||> Sun Myung Moon, Thirteenth Foundation Day for the Nation of the Unified World

To build God's kingdom [you] should be willing to do something really difficult, even if it is difficult. God knows what I am doing. |||> Sun Myung Moon, East Garden Speech (April 18th)

By learning about God, growing spiritually, having Hoon Dok Hae every day, you can carry on the tradition of everything I have done so far. |||> Sun Myung Moon, Thirteenth Foundation Day for the Nation of the Unified World

Your study is not for your family or for the Unification Church, but for the world and God. And you have to study harder to save the world and God. (130-321) |||> Sun Myung Moon, The Way for Students

Depending on your determination, the environment around you can change. You must be full of conviction. |||> Sun Myung Moon, Thirteenth Foundation Day for the Nation of the Unified World

There is no such thing as number 2, only number 1. Why? Because God and True Parents deserve number 1. |||> Hyun Jin Moon, Inauguration as International President of YFWP

Your mind, on Sunday morning, says "I want to go to Belvedere." But your body says, "True Father won't come." Later on, if you have given into your bodily desire and you find True Father came and spoke, you will regret it. Those who have the confidence that your lineage is not contaminated at all, show your hands. No one? What shall we do? What choice do we have? |||> Sun Myung Moon, Purity, Lineage, and the Love Organ (of Life)

Therefore all a person must accomplish is to receive the "certificate" of God's love. God can make the world a totally peaceful place. Satan will be unable to complain against God at all. When we finally possess God's love, we never want to commit a crime or a sin at all. The reason why people commit crimes and sin is that they want something they don't have. When God's love is with us we are satisfied and have no need for anything more. |||> Sun Myung Moon, God’s Warning to the World II

If you cannot have the unchanging ideas for the fulfillment of the creation that can be eternally rejoiced in by God, you will become a betrayer of God at some point. Therefore, only when you actualize the ideal of creation from God's viewpoint will the heavenly ideal be actualized and made substantial in reality. God has been leading the dispensation for 6,000 years for the fulfillment of this will. If you cannot accomplish the will of God, His providence will fail and will remain on the level of nothing but ideas. |||> Sun Myung Moon, The Person Who is To Remain Before God’s Will

This is the reason why we go the path we go. This is why I have welcomed persecution and will not shrink from the course that lies before me. I never pray to smooth my way or to lighten my burden. I will fulfill my own portion of responsibility. |||> Sun Myung Moon, God’s Warning to the World II

Satan blinds people to their true condition and convinces them they are happy. To protect the world from further mistreatment by Satan, we must liberate the young people. Otherwise Satan will have the world in his hands, a world like a living corpse.

When a cancer starts, the victim hardly notices it. As it progresses, he notices it only a little bit. However, that person will probably die unless the cancer is stopped. America is in the same situation. I have been telling you Christians that you cannot remain idle or indifferent. You cannot just think about your own life and your own family and going to Heaven eventually. That attitude among conventional Christians is a problem. |||> Sun Myung Moon, God’s Warning to the World II

One must invest oneself to become greater. This is the truth. You should understand that this is the basic rule of progress in the phenomenal world. You all want to extend out and make progress, right? If the answer is "Yes," then you must invest yourself. Sincere investment will make sincere expansion and development possible. Casual investment will bring haphazard results, while sincere investment will bring serious results. Is that true or false? Is it true or false? [It is true] Is that really so? [Yes] |||> Sun Myung Moon, The Way of the Spiritual Leader II

In the Unification Church, we express this concept in simple terms by using the words, "sacrifice yourself in true ways," and believe that this is only possible through the road of true sacrifice. What is sacrifice? It is pouring in and investing oneself. If you want to do business you should give up money. You must give up the money that you have earned with the deepest love. Investing is the same. Do you understand? [Yes] Sacrifice in true ways means investing oneself. True investment . . . it means that you should make a true investment. (129-60) |||> Sun Myung Moon, The Way of the Spiritual Leader II

Without God's love there cannot be any progress, and where there is absence of God's love, existence itself will be destroyed. (27-342) |||> Sun Myung Moon, The Way of the Spiritual Leader II

For any organization to make progress, there must be a center that can influence the organization and there must be a purpose that the organization can pursue. The greater the scale of the organization that seeks to reach its goals, the greater is the probability that the organization will be divided into departments. In each department, there is a leader who works under the central figure of the organization. The organization can progress forward and realize all of its goals and plans when departmental heads and their members can unite vertically as well as become one with those in other departments. By looking at examples in society and our daily life, we can see that this is true. |||> Sun Myung Moon, The Way of the Spiritual Leader II

To found a company, three factors -- management, facility, and technology -- must be harmonized as one. All things and events follow this rule of three. Philosophers nowadays talk about the "great three" philosophy, but we have established the philosophy of four-position foundation. It is much greater. Until yesterday it was like a two-dimensional plane, but our philosophy is three-dimensional. Therefore, the only one that will live on is our Divine Principles. Do you or do you not know this fact? [We know] You know? [Yes] (26-193) |||> Sun Myung Moon, The Way of the Spiritual Leader II

The person of authority will perish if he is not always in the position of giving. After I rise to a high position I must be able to give to those in the low positions. Only by abiding by this Principle will everything develop. (141-44) |||> Sun Myung Moon, The Way of the Spiritual Leader II

Until now, the history of fallen men has progressed centering on the foundation which can bring the development into a world greater than the individual, family, the nation, the world, and the universe. But this is not how it should be. It has been six thousand years since the fall of Adam and Eve. If humanity had the world view which led them to cherish the day six thousand years ago rather than place all hopes in the world six thousand years later, then the world would have already been unified. But because humanity was in the position where they had to place all hopes in the future, the history was delayed until today. (25-115) |||> Sun Myung Moon, The Way of the Spiritual Leader II

I believe that the advancement of the Unification Church in America depends on me. If I become a leader that is indebted to you, the church will never develop. My philosophy is that when I become a leader whom all of you are indebted to, the church will advance forward. This has been my attitude until now. Moreover, my philosophy is that I must feel more desperate than the spirit world, God or the angelic world. This is how I think about the world. I first think about the world and then think about the Unification Church. I live for the sake of the world and the world of God's will. Therefore, I do not believe that if I, who have been always thinking about the world despite heavy persecution, die without fulfilling the will, then the Unification Church will disappear. The day I die, I must alleviate the suffering of God. I must advance it forward even more. Do you understand what I am saying? I believe that there exists God who will answer my prayers and help accomplish the will, so the Unification Church will not perish until the will is done. I think in this way from the moment I awake and walk toward the bathroom. I think about this 24 hours a day whether I am awake or asleep. Wherever I go, whomever I meet . . . Do you understand? Therefore, I am not someone who will be indebted to you. I am not one who will be indebted. A leader who owes debt is truly an unworthy leader. (93-95) |||> Sun Myung Moon, The Way of the Spiritual Leader II

Viewing it centering on Unification Church, for the Unification Church to progress, you must digest everything, including all that is good and bad. If you say, "I can digest good things but cannot digest bad things," then who will be responsible? The burden will all be inherited by your descendants.
